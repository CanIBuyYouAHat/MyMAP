# MyMAP
Simple, rudimentary network scanner built for fun/an exercise in network mapping

**This project was built for educational purposes. Always get permission before scanning a network.**

# USAGE
## Dependencies
MyMAP relies on the Netifaces and Netaddr libraries
1. ```python3 -m pip install netifaces```
2. ```python3 -m pip install netaddr```

Following installation, run with 
```./implant```

By default, debug mode is enabled and will display all addresses and ports that are scanned.
(Quiet mode to be added in a future update)
